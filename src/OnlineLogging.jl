"""
    report_walltime(wt::WallTimeInfo, integrator)

Report the current progress and estimated completion time of a simulation.

This function calculates and displays various timing statistics based on the provided
`WallTimeInfo` (`wt`) and the `integrator` state. It estimates the remaining wall time,
total simulation time, and simulated time per real-time unit.

Prints a summary of the simulation progress to the console, including:

- `simulation_time`: The current simulated time.
- `n_steps_completed`: The number of completed steps.
- `wall_time_per_step`: Average wall time per simulation step. You should expect this to be
                        unreliable until the number of completed steps is large.
- `wall_time_total`: Estimated total wall time for the simulation. You should expect this to be
                     unreliable until the number of completed steps is large.
- `wall_time_remaining`: Estimated remaining wall time. You should expect this to be
                         unreliable until the number of completed steps is large.
- `wall_time_spent`: Total wall time spent so far.
- `percent_complete`: Percentage of the simulation completed.
- `estimated_sypd`: Estimated simulated years per day (or simulated days per day if sypd is
                    very small). You should expect this to be unreliable until the number of
                    completed steps is large.
- `date_now`: The current date and time.
- `estimated_finish_date`: The estimated date and time of simulation completion. You should
                           expect this to be unreliable until the number of completed steps
                           is large.

!!! note

    Average quantities and simulated-years-per-day are computed by taking the total time
    elapsed (minus initial compilation) and dividing by the number of steps completed. You
    should expect them to fluctuate heavily and to be unreliable until the number of steps
    become large. "Large" is defined by your problem: for example, the code has to go
    through all the callbacks and diagnostics a few times before stabilizing (and this is
    different for different simulations).

## Arguments:

* `wt::WallTimeInfo`:  A struct containing wall time information.
* `integrator`: The integrator object containing simulation state information, including the
                 current time `t`, timestep `dt`. It also have to have time span `tspan`
                 in `integrator.sol.prob.tspan`.

## How to use `report_walltime`

`report_walltime` is intended to be used as a callback executed at the end of a simulation
step. The callback can be called with an arbitrary schedule, so that reporting can be
customized.

### Example

Suppose we want to report progress every 10 steps in a `SciMLBase`-type of integrator.
```julia
import ClimaUtilities.OnlineLogging: WallTimeInfo, report_progress
import SciMLBase

# Prepare the WallTimeInfo
walltime_info = WallTimeInfo()

# Define schedule, a boolean function that takes the integrator
every10steps(u, t, integrator) = mod(integrator.step, 10) == 0

# Define the callback, we use `let` to make this a little faster
report = let wt = walltime_info
     (integrator) -> report_progress(wt, integrator)
end
report_callback = SciMLBase.DiscreteCallback(every10steps, report)

# Then, we can attach this callback to the integrator
```
TODO: Discuss/link `Schedules` when we move them to `ClimaUtilities`.
